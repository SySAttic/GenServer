Rules of Engagement
 
* Protect Your Personal Information: CD-keys, credit card numbers, home addresses, etc. should never be given to other players and will never be requested by EA.
* Watch Out For External Software Programs: Some “trainers” offer the ability to cheat online.  In reality, they will extract your personal information from your computer (sniffers).  Do not use them.
