So far as much as i can tell 
when you connect to generals servserv.generals.ea.com 80
it will send commands to http to receive config & Rest of needed files 

Similar to WOL ServServ GameresServ


Then it will quit from servserv.generals.ea.com
connect to one of the servs below.
Thats when you wanna send the gemtest.cpp code,

So far it goes to lobby without config files when i tested,
Let me know bugs you come across

Code is reallymessy,

Simple serv to reply to Gen commands,
